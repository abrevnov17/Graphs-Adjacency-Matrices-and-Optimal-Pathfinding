# Graphs-Adjacency-Matrices-and-Optimal-Pathfinding
This was an assignment for my Advanced Computer science class. In this assignment, I had to write methods to tackle a few classic pathfinding problems such as determining whether a path exists between two given nodes, whether that path was optimal, what is the optimal path, etc...

The code is all written in Java and mainly relies on a Breadth first search. We are given an adjacency matrix as an input that is found in a text file, which we read in and analyze.
